I'm thinking one page:
-> Status of RPi
    - 'Running' or 'Stopped'
    - 'Current temp'
    - 'Target temp'
    - Timer info if state == 'Running'
        + time left
-> Ability to schedule a cook
    - Time to start (Assumes today, so only time, no date)
    - Duration

TODO:
-> If cook is scheduled show info on that (maybe instead of schedule):
    - Time started
    - Progress bar
    - Time end
    - Stop button?

MISSING:
Fault tolerance if the device disconnects. It rips the whole web server.
    - The issue happens once the device disconnects. it would be reasonable to have 3 retries 1 second apart on the
      sendCommand function. If it fails, softfail, and let web app know, so it can react accordingly
